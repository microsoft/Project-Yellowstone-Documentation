# Manufacturing Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Manufacturing Power BI app for Business Central is designed to provide insights into your manufacturing activities. This app with its multiple reports aims to help you streamline manufacturing processes, improve decision-making at all levels of the organization, and optimize production efficiency by offering detailed analytics and visualizations of manufacturing data.


## Manufacturing analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:
- Chief Operating Officer
- Chief Manufacturing Officer
  
### Example scenario: analyzing current utilization
 
As a COO, you need to ensure that your manufacturing plant is operating at optimal levels. By analyzing the [Current Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-current-utilization.md) and [Historical Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-historical-utilization.md) reports, you can get a better understanding of how efficiently your resources are being utilized and identify areas for improvement.

You can also use the [Work Center Load](manufacturing-powerbi-work-center-load.md) report to identify bottlenecks in your production process and make informed decisions to increase efficiency and productivity.


## Manufacturing analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Manufacturing Manager
- Operations Manager

### Example Scenario: improving resource usage

As a Manufacturing Manager, you are responsible for ensuring that all production orders are completed on time and within budget. Using the [Finished Production Order Breakdown](manufacturing-powerbi-finished-production-order-breakdown.md) and [Average Production Times](manufacturing-powerbi-avergage-production-times.md) reports, you can analyze the production time for each order and identify opportunities to optimize the production process.

The [Allocated Hours](manufacturing-powerbi-allocated-hours.md) report provides a detailed breakdown of allocated hours and aggregates these hours by work center. This report can help you identify any unexpected spikes in resource usage.

By using the [Released Production Orders](manufacturing-powerbi-released-production-orders.md) report, you can also identify any discrepancies in production patterns across different orders and make decisions.

## Manufacturing analytics for warehouse staff

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:
- Manufacturing Supervisor
- Production Operator

### Example Scenario: tracking production lines

As a manufacturing supervisor, you are responsible for ensuring the smooth flow of goods and materials within the manufacturing facility. Your role is critical in maintaining the production schedule and meeting customer demand. The [Current Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-current-utilization.md) report allows you to see the real-time utilization of work centers, which helps you identify bottlenecks and optimize production processes.

You notice that one work center is consistently operating at full capacity, while others are underutilized. You use the [Historical Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-historical-utilization.md) report to analyze the historical utilization of work centers and identify trends and patterns. This helps you plan for future capacity needs and balance production across different work centers.

To improve production efficiency, you track the allocated hours for each work center using the [Allocated Hours](manufacturing-powerbi-allocated-hours.md) report. This helps you understand workloads and adjust staffing levels accordingly.

## How to use the reports in the Manufacturing app

The following table describes how you can use the Power BI reports in the Manufacturing app.
