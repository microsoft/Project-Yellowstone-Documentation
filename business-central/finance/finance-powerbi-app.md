# Finance Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article explains how to use the embedded Power BI reports to analyze finance data. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data in curated reports with pre-defined KPIs. 

The Power BI reports on finance data supports many analytics scenarios relevant for finance processes.

Executives and the leadership team typically consumes the data through high-level dashboards that present key financial performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs aggregate data to provide a clear and concise overview of overall financial health, highlighting essential performance metrics. This approach allows Leadership to quickly assess performance against strategic goals and make informed decisions without getting lost in granular details.

Managers and team leaders engage with the data through detailed managerial reports, which are designed to showcase trends and summaries. Data is aggregated over time to reveal patterns and highlight areas requiring attention. These reports provide context through charts, visualizations, and comparisons, helping Management to understand underlying trends, identify risks, and make data-driven tactical adjustments.

Finance staff accesses operational reports that offer detailed, granular-level data. These reports focus on providing task-specific information necessary for daily functions. Staff can mine the data for specific transactions, process monitoring, and operational insights, ensuring effective day-to-day management of financial activities.

The different reports in the finance Power BI app can be used for different things depending on your role. Below, you can read some examples of use cases for different roles in your organization. 

## Finance analytics for the leadership team
To fit this category, you might have a role such as:
- Executive
- Director
- Other high-level decision maker

As the CFO you are preparing for an upcoming board meeting and need to prepare an analysis of your company's financial position for the current fiscal quarter.

Using the Financial Overview report, you begin with a comparative analysis of revenues. This quarter's revenue of $281,000 represents a significant increase compared to the same period last year of $242,000, marking a growth of $39,000, or approximately 16.1%. This positive trend indicates strong performance and suggests that current strategies are effectively driving increased revenue.

You want to compare the Net Profit Margin for the current quarter versus the same period in the previous year. You quickly identify that Net Profit Margins are slightly lower but you will need more information to determine why.

By analyzing the [Profitability](#TODO) report you can easily see that expenses are up from 3.60K to 11.85K for the same period. Although revenue is up by approximately 16.1% the increase in expenses has suppressed growth and produced a marginal increase in profits.

To ensure the company is able to cover it's short-term obligations, fund new initiatives and maintain operational stability you review the liquidity report and cash reserves. 

The cash ratio of 1.0 indicates that the company has enough cash and cash equivalents (1.02M) to pay off all current liabilities (1.02M) immediately if needed. The quick ratio of 1.15 indicates that without including inventory in current assets, the company can still cover it's short-term debts without relying on sales of inventory. Overall, the current ratio of 1.21 indicates the company is in a balanced but cautious liquidity position with current assets of $1.24M to current liabilities of 1.02M.

## Finance analytics for the management team
As the operations manager you are responsible for overseeing service delivery across various customer segments. These customer groups are tracked as dimensions values (Large, Medium and Small) by the Customer Group global dimension.

By filtering the Budget Comparison report by Global Dimension 2 and G/L Account Category to Income and Expense, you can easily track budget performance. This allows you to allocate resources more effectively, keep control of the budget and make data-driven decisions when forecasting in the future.

## Finance analytics for daily finance work
As a member of the accounts receivable team, you are responsible for managing the inflow of cash by ensuring timely and efficient collection of payments from customers. To monitor and prioritize your efforts, you use the Aged Receivables (Back Dating) report. 

Analyzing by payment terms code allows you to quickly identify customers who have outstanding balances in aging buckets beyond 30 days. You can now prioritize not only customers but the invoices those customers should pay first.
