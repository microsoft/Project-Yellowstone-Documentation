Revenue is the top line of the income statement and reflects the total value of transactions with customers before deducting any expenses, such as the cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses, taxes, or interest.

**KPI description**

Gross Profit Margin is a financial metric that indicates the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS).

This metric is essential for understanding a company's profitability before accounting for other expenses like selling, general, and administrative costs.

By analyzing Gross Profit Margin, businesses can identify inefficiencies in their production processes or supply chains and take measures to reduce costs, thereby improving profitability.
- **Pricing Strategy Assessment:** To determine the effectiveness of current pricing strategies businesses can compare Gross Profit Margin across different dimensions such as product lines or services. A low margin might indicate the need for a price increase or cost reduction, while a high margin might suggest pricing power or the potential to lower prices to gain market share.
