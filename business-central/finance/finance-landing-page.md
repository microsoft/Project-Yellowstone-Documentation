# Finance App for Business Central

This article explains how to use the built-in **Power BI reports** to analyze finance data. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data in curated reports with pre-defined KPIs. 

The Power BI reports on finance data supports many analytics scenarios relevant for finance processes.

## Overview

The Finance report is a versatile tool designed to meet the unique needs of various stakeholders within an organization, including Leadership, Management, and Staff. 

- **Leadership** typically consumes the data through high-level dashboards that present key financial performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs aggregate data to provide a clear and concise overview of overall financial health, highlighting essential performance metrics. This approach allows Leadership to quickly assess performance against strategic goals and make informed decisions without getting lost in granular details.

- **Management** engages with the data through detailed managerial reports, which are designed to showcase trends and summaries. Data is aggregated over time to reveal patterns and highlight areas requiring attention. These reports provide context through charts, visualizations, and comparisons, helping Management to understand underlying trends, identify risks, and make data-driven tactical adjustments.

- **Staff** accesses operational reports that offer detailed, granular-level data. These reports focus on providing task-specific information necessary for daily functions. Staff can mine the data for specific transactions, process monitoring, and operational insights, ensuring effective day-to-day management of financial activities.

Through aggregation and customized presentation, the Finance report provides tailored insights at different levels of detail, enabling informed decision-making for every stakeholder in the organization.
