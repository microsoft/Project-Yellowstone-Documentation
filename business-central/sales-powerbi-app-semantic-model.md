# Sales App Semantic Model

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Sales semantic model is organized in a  [Star Schema Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/star-schema#star-schema-overview). 

The fact tables contains information about individual transactions from sources such as sales orders, posted sales invoices and posted credit memos from Business Central. 

The dimension tables provide additional context and attributes to the transactional data, such as customer and product information.
