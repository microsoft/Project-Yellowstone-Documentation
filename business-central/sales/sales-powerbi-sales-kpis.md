## Customer Table

**Customer Measures**
- [No. of Customers](#no-of-customers)
- [No. of Lost Customers](#no-of-lost-customers)
- [No. of New Customers](#no-of-new-customers)
- [No. of Recovered Customers](#no-of-recovered-customers)
- [No. of Returning Customers](#no-of-returning-customers)
- [Sales Lost Customers (12M)](#sales-lost-customers-12m)
- [Sales New Customers](#sales-new-customers)
- [Sales Recovered Customers](#sales-recovered-customers)
- [Sales Returning Customers](#sales-returning-customers)

### No. of Customers
**Formula**  
Distinct count of Customer No. column from the Sales table.

**Data Sources**
- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Lost Customers
**Formula**  
This measure calculates the number of customers who have been "lost" within the current date selection. It first determines the latest date in the selection, prepares a table of customers and their associated "lost" dates, and then filters out the customers whose lost date falls within the selected date range. Finally, it counts the rows in this filtered table to get the number of lost customers.

**Data Sources**
- Value Entries
- Sales Line


### No. of New Customers
**Formula**  
This measure identifies and counts new customers by finding the date of their first purchase and ensures that only customers with first purchase dates within the current date selection are included.

**Data Sources**
- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Recovered Customers
**Formula**  
This measure identifies calculates the number of customers who were temporarily lost (stopped purchasing) but later made a new purchase. It first identifies customers who had a "lost" date before the selected date range, then determines which customers made a new purchase within the current period. The measure filters and counts only those customers whose new purchase occurred after their lost date, returning the total number of recovered customers.

**Data Sources**
- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Returning Customers
**Formula**  
This measure calculates the number of customers who made a repeat purchase during the current period. It identifies existing customers by filtering those whose first purchase occurred before the selected date range, then determines which of these existing customers made another purchase within the current period. The measure returns the count of these returning customers.

**Data Sources**
- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Lost Customers (12M)
**Formula**  
This measure calculates the total sales lost over the past 12 months due to customers who are no longer purchasing (lost customers). It first identifies the most recent "lost" date, then filters customers who were lost by that date. It retrieves the sales from the previous 12 months for these lost customers, calculating the total revenue they generated before they stopped purchasing.

**Data Sources**
- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales New Customers
**Formula**

**Data Sources**
- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Recovered Customers
**Formula**  
This measure calculates the total sales generated by recovered customers, those who were previously lost but made a purchase after being lost. It identifies temporarily lost customers, checks if they have made a new purchase in the current period, and then sums the sales made by these recovered customers.

**Data Sources**
- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Returning Customers
**Formula**  
This measure calculates the total sales generated by returning customers, defined as those who made their first purchase before the current period and have made additional purchases in the current period. It identifies returning customers by finding the intersection of active customers and those who had purchased previously, and then sums the sales from these returning customers.
